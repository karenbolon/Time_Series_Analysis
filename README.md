# [Project: Time Series Analysis](https://github.com/spicedacademy/fenugreek-student-code/tree/karen/week_07_project)

* Created a short-term temperature forecast using data from (www.ecad.eu).
* Built a baseline model modelling trend and seasonality, plotted and inspected the different components of a time series.
* Used the following models to model the time dependence of the remainder:
	- Linear Regression
	- Autoregression
	- Auto Regressive Integreated Moving Average (ARIMA)
* Evaluated the model using Cross-Validation Time Series Split
